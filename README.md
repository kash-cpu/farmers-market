# Project-Portfolio-for-team
This project is titled Farmers Market.
Farmers Market is a web based application that allows the general public to buy farm produce directly from the farm.

Mission: Our mission is to bridge the gap between the consumers and the farmers. Creating a platform that allow people to buy directly from the farm will help in mitigating the effect of inflation on the general public.

Vision: Our vision is to be among the leading successful e-commerces in the world that brings comfort and happiness to its users.
The technology involved in Farmers Market includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP.
The web application is hosted using OOOwebhosting.
